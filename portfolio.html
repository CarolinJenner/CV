                <p>the concept • „The world as we know it is dissolving. But behind it, a new world is coming together
                    whose formation we can at least guess at.“ - Matthias Horx
                    At the end of 2019, a previously unknown, highly contagious virus emerged in Wuhan, China. It
                    quickly spread globally as well. In January 2020, the virus reached Germany. As a result of the
                    rapid spread and to mitigate it, a so-called lockdown was ordered for each wave of the virus. This
                    consisted of ordered closures of restaurants and leisure facilities, contact restrictions outdoors
                    and indoors, as well as the ordering of a compulsory home office. For example, between January and
                    April 2020, as well as in the same period in 2021, up to ~47% of the German population was less in
                    the office than at the beginning of the year.</p>
                <p>Thus, in these lockdown phases, the leisure time as well as the professional life of a large part of
                    the population is concentrated on their own living space and thus consequently on a different living
                    space than they were used to before. Under these changed circumstances, the question of what
                    significance this has for people‘s clothing during lockdown will be discussed below. Does this
                    change influence the way people wear clothing? Can living in the lockdown create new framework
                    conditions for clothing in the future and what might these look like?</p>
                <p>First, it can be hypothesised that under the influence of the Lockdown, the target group has
                    experienced reorientation and the questioning of their values. They focus on the self and
                    well-being. Furthermore, the need to break up predefined dress codes and open up to casual,
                    comfort-oriented clothing for all occasions, but without losing a certain elegance and attitude in
                    the look, can be seen.</p>
                <p>These are defined by bright colours, wide and comfortable cuts and fabrics that know how to combine
                    these factors.</p>
                <p>Fashion after the lockdown gives back the missed feeling of life after the monotony and emptiness in
                    the lockdown and lives this through bright colours and soft shapes.
                    People return to their lives after the lockdown and underline this euphoria with the rediscovered
                    self-dramatisation by uniting comfort and opulence.</p>
