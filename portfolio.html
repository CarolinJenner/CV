            <p><strong>the concept</strong> • <q>The world as we know it is dissolving. But behind it, a new world is
                    coming together whose formation we can at least guess at.</q> - Matthias Horx <br>
                At the end of 2019, a previously unknown, highly contagious virus emerged in Wuhan, China. It
                quickly spread globally as well. In January 2020, the virus reached Germany. As a result of the
                rapid spread and to mitigate it, a so-called lockdown was ordered for each wave of the virus. This
                consisted of ordered closures of restaurants and leisure facilities, contact restrictions outdoors
                and indoors, as well as the ordering of a compulsory home office. For example, between January and
                April 2020, as well as in the same period in 2021, up to ~47% of the German population was less in
                the office than at the beginning of the year.</p>
            <p>Thus, in these lockdown phases, the leisure time as well as the professional life of a large part of
                the population is concentrated on their own living space and thus consequently on a different living
                space than they were used to before. Under these changed circumstances, the question of what
                significance this has for people‘s clothing during lockdown will be discussed below. Does this
                change influence the way people wear clothing? Can living in the lockdown create new framework
                conditions for clothing in the future and what might these look like?</p>
            <p>These First, it can be hypothesised that under the influence of the Lockdown, the target group has
                experienced reorientation and the questioning of their values. They focus on the self and
                well-being. Furthermore, the need to break up predefined dress codes and open up to casual,
                comfort-oriented clothing for all occasions, but without losing a certain elegance and attitude in
                the look, can be seen.<br>
                These are defined by bright colours, wide and comfortable cuts and fabrics that know how to combine
                these factors.</p>
            <p>Fashion after the lockdown gives back the missed feeling of life after the monotony and emptiness in
                the lockdown and lives this through bright colours and soft shapes.<br>
                People return to their lives after the lockdown and underline this euphoria with the rediscovered
                self-dramatisation by uniting comfort and opulence.</p>
